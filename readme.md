#Mouse Move Noises with JQuery

##Making cool noises using the webkit audio API

Just a bit of experimentation to see what I can get out of the webkit audio API to start with.

- Moving the mouse around the screen plays different notes/instruments according to mouse position
- Vertical mouse movements affect the attack and decay
- Horizontal mouse movements affect the note played

I added some readoout on screen just to see what's going on and some colours too cos colour is cool.

##Future additions (if i get there)
- it would be nice to have a trail on the mouse (i'd like to work this out anyway)
- be able to chnage the length of the notes
- maybe include a switch that chnages the mouse listener between move/down (and drag maybe..?)
- I'd like to try out some different sound libraries to see what else i can get - I think band.js may be a little too strucutred to get any really cool noises out of it - I'd like to be able to chnage the speed of oscillation and attack/sustain etc.

##Next stop with webkit audio apis?
See if I can make some RESONABLE sounds that don't just sound like a transformer transforming (as addictive as that might be).
