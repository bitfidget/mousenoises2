#Mouse Move Noises with JQuery

Just a little bit of experimentation with jquery and the band.js library. (https://github.com/meenie/band.js/)

I wanted to see what sound you coud get out of the band.js library defaults.

Basic mechanics are - moving the mouse around the screen payes different notes/instruments according to mouse position. Vertical mouse movements affects the instrument (9 options - 4 different occilations and 5 different tones) and horizontal movement affects the actual note played (36 notes possible i think?).

I added some readoout on screen just to see what's going on and some colours too cos colour is cool.

##Future additions (if i get there)
- it would be nice to have a trail on the mouse (i'd like to work this out anyway)
- be able to chnage the length of the notes
- maybe include a switch that chnages the mouse listener between move/down (and drag maybe..?)
- I'd like to try out some different sound libraries to see what else i can get - I think band.js may be a little too strucutred to get any really cool noises out of it - I'd like to be able to chnage the speed of oscillation and attack/sustain etc.
